Kickstarter Analysis for Louise

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise - an-up-and-coming playwright - in designing a succesful crowdfunding campagin for her play "Fever." The analysis is intended to give Louise a greater understanding of crowdfunding campaigns in the US from start to finish so that she can appropriately mirror the successful ones and "kickstart" her production. 

## Analysis and Challenges

To perform the analysis, we used a variety of qualitative and quantitative analyses, including conditional formating, sorting and filtering, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, descriptive statistics, and visualization of the results through charts.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Louise should aim to start her campaign in May for best results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Our analysis indicates two sweet spots for goals based on funding success: less than $15,000 and between $35,000 and $45,000. Since Louise has already created an estimate of $10,000 to get her play made, she is well within the range of goals that have good success rates on Kickstarter.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) May is undeniably the best month to begin a Kickstarter campaign for theater projects. 
2) April to August is the best time of year to begin theater campagins but, if you can't do that, October, and February are the other months that have slightly better reported outcomes, outside of summer. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Smaller goals for plays are more successful up to the $15,000 mark. Between $15,001 and $35,000, campaigns to fund plays in the US are more likely to fail than to succeed. BUT there is a small positive reversal for funding ranges between $35,001 and $44,999. Anything larger than that is almost guaranteed to fail. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1) Kickstarter is only one of several crowdfunding campaign sites. It is possible that other sites have more successful outcomes for funding plays than Kickstarter. 
2) This data set only includes campaigns up through 2017. We don't know how more recent campaigns similar to Louise's have fared. 
3) Successfully funding a campaign does not necessarily translate into a successfully launched play. It would be interesting and useful to know if the successfully-funded play campaigns resulted in actual productions and if the amount pledged/achieved was appropriate for the project.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1) Outcomes based on deadline instead of launch date
2) How average donation affects the success of a campaign
3) Popularity of Kickstarter campaigns for plays in different countries
